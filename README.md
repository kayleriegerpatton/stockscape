## About The Project

Stockscape tests usersâ€™ skills as they build portfolios and compete for the highest year-end earnings.

A full-stack web application, Stockscape takes inspiration from the chaos of the 2021 financial market; a time when many took interest in the stock market and how they could succeed. Users start with $1,000,000 in game funds to invest in their choice of up to 100 different company stocks. Year-end earnings are calculated instantly and displayed on the user's dashboard as a leaderboard of top Stockscape portfolios and within their portfolios list. Users can view other users' profiles and portfolios, update their public profile, and create as many investment portfolios as they wish.
